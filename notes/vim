Vim starts in NORMAL MODE

- to input text like Notepad, go into INSERT MODE first with one of: i, I, a, A, o, O

- i: insert under cursor
- I: insert at beginning of current line
- a: insert after cursor
- A: insert at end of current line
- o: insert below current line
- O: insert above current line

- to go back into NORMAL mode, use ESC, or CTRL-[, or "kj" quickly
